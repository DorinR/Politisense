### Problem We Are Seeking To Solve
Lack of civic engagement in politics. <br />
Voting happens once every 4 years. During the 4 years periods in between elections, voters are generally not very aware of the activity of their representatives in Parliament. 

### Our Solution <br />
Build a tool that will enable voters to effortlessly stay aware of the activity of their representatives.
